## 2026-03-14 — Wave 32: Security + Skepticism Audit

### Security — innerHTML XSS Audit (Unit Tested)
- Audited 427 innerHTML occurrences across 43 frontend panels
- Fixed 6 high-risk unescaped user data injection points:
  - `map-maplibre.js`: unit name, type, fsmState in tooltip now escaped via `_escFx()`
  - `map-maplibre.js`: upgraded `_escFx()` to also escape `&` and `"`
  - `targets.js`: camera name/channel in dropdown now escaped via `escapeHtml()`
  - `assets.js`: camera_url injection replaced with DOM API (`createElement('img')`) + protocol whitelist
  - `analytics.js`: added `_esc()` function, escaped target labels and thumbnail IDs
  - `zones.js`: added `_esc()` function, escaped zone names, types, IDs, monitored objects
  - `war-hud.js`: wave name now escaped via `_hudEscapeHtml()`
- Confirmed 20+ panels already use `_esc()` or `escapeHtml()` properly
- Remaining innerHTML uses are safe (static strings, numeric values, or already-escaped data)

### Security — Rate Limiting Verification (Unit Tested)
- 5 new tests in `test_rate_limit_http.py` proving middleware works end-to-end:

  - Sends 100 rapid requests with limit=20, verifies exactly 20 pass and 80 blocked
  - Verifies disabled mode allows all requests through

### Skepticism — Demo Mode E2E Pipeline (Unit Tested)

  - DemoController can be imported, started, stopped
  - DemoController generates targets after 3 seconds of running

### Skepticism — Frontend Panel Audit (Documented)
- Audited all 43 frontend panels for backend connectivity:
  - 36 panels have real API backends (via routers or plugins)
  - 7 panels use EventBus/TritiumStore only (alerts, escalation, events, minimap, sensors, target-compare, unit-inspector)
  - All panels with API calls point to real endpoints (plugins provide edge_tracker, camera_feeds, rf_motion, automation routes)
  - No "empty shell" panels found — all panels have functional data sources
