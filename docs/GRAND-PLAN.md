# GRAND PLAN: Overnight Autonomous Build

**Date**: 2026-02-22
**Branch**: dev
**Goal**: Make the neighborhood Nerf battle simulator feel real — streets, scale, pathfinding, graphics, fake camera feeds, and a polished UI — all driven by tests that prove it works.

---

## Philosophy

Every feature below is defined by what the **test report** shows when it passes. If there's no test, the feature doesn't exist. Agent teams work autonomously, save status to `docs/overnight-status/`, and commit frequently to dev so progress is never lost.

---

## WORKSTREAM 1: Street-Aware Navigation

**Current state**: Units move in straight lines through buildings. No pathfinding, no obstacles, no street data.

**Target state**: Units follow real streets from OpenStreetMap. Rovers drive on roads. Drones fly direct. Hostiles approach via streets and cut through yards. Buildings are obstacles.

### 1A. Extract Street Graph from OSM

Pull road segments from Overpass API for the configured geo-reference, build a NetworkX graph with intersections as nodes and road segments as edges.

**File**: `src/amy/tactical/street_graph.py`

**Test report shows**:
| Test | Assertion |
|------|-----------|
| `test_street_graph_loads` | Graph has >= 10 nodes and >= 8 edges for neighborhood_default geo |
| `test_street_graph_nearest_node` | Given a point, nearest road node is within 50m |
| `test_street_graph_shortest_path` | A* path between two road nodes has >= 2 segments |
| `test_street_graph_path_follows_roads` | Every waypoint in path is within 5m of a road segment |
| `test_street_graph_caching` | Second load uses disk cache, completes in < 10ms |
| `test_street_graph_no_network` | Gracefully falls back to direct waypoints when offline |

### 1B. Building Footprints as Obstacles

Pull building polygons from Overpass API. Units cannot path through buildings.

**File**: `src/amy/tactical/obstacles.py`

**Test report shows**:
| Test | Assertion |
|------|-----------|
| `test_buildings_loaded` | >= 5 building polygons within 200m of center |
| `test_point_inside_building` | Known building center returns True |
| `test_point_outside_building` | Known street point returns False |
| `test_path_avoids_buildings` | Path from A to B does not cross any building polygon |

### 1C. A* Pathfinding on Street Graph

Replace straight-line waypoint following with A* on the street graph. Different unit types use different strategies.

**File**: `src/amy/simulation/pathfinding.py`

**Test report shows**:
| Test | Assertion |
|------|-----------|
| `test_rover_follows_roads` | Rover path stays within 3m of road centerline |
| `test_drone_flies_direct` | Drone path is straight line (ignores roads) |
| `test_hostile_approaches_via_street` | Hostile enters on road, then cuts through yard near objective |
| `test_turret_no_path` | Turret has empty path (stationary) |
| `test_path_distance_realistic` | A 100m straight-line trip becomes ~120-180m on roads |
| `test_path_recalculation` | When dispatch target changes, path recalculates within 1 tick |
| `test_unit_turns_at_intersections` | Heading changes smoothly at waypoints, not instant snap |

### 1D. Wire Pathfinding into SimulationEngine

**Test report shows**:
| Test | Assertion |
|------|-----------|
| `test_sim_engine_uses_pathfinder` | Engine tick moves rover along road path, not straight line |
| `test_hostile_spawns_on_road_edge` | Hostile spawn position is on a road at map boundary |
| `test_dispatch_generates_road_path` | POST /api/game/place produces road-following waypoints |
| `test_integration_10_wave_with_roads` | Full 10-wave battle completes; all unit movements follow roads |

---

## WORKSTREAM 2: Realistic Scale and Layout

**Current state**: 19 objects in a 400m x 400m box. Patrol routes are rectangles that don't match real streets.

**Target state**: Layout matches the actual neighborhood. Units patrol real streets. Turrets are placed at real intersections.

### 2A. Neighborhood Layout Overhaul

Regenerate `neighborhood_default.json` with positions that match real satellite imagery.

**Test report shows**:
| Test | Assertion |
|------|-----------|
| `test_layout_units_on_roads` | All rover/drone spawn positions are within 10m of a road |

| `test_rover_traversal_time` | Rover at 3 m/s crosses 200m patrol in ~80-120 seconds |
| `test_drone_traversal_time` | Drone at 5 m/s crosses 400m map in ~80-100 seconds |
| `test_hostile_approach_time` | Hostile at 2 m/s takes 60-150 seconds from edge to objective |
| `test_intercept_range_realistic` | Interception happens at 2m (~1 body length) |
| `test_turret_range_realistic` | Turret engagement range is 30-50m (~1 house lot) |
| `test_visual_scale_pixel_ratio` | At default zoom, 1 house lot (20m) is 50-80 pixels wide |

---

## WORKSTREAM 3: Unit Graphics and Visual Polish

**Current state**: Units are colored circles/rectangles. No sprites, no rotation, no distinct silhouettes.

**Target state**: Each unit type has a recognizable icon that rotates with heading. Hostiles look different from friendlies at a glance.

### 3A. Unit Icon System

Replace geometric shapes with purpose-drawn Canvas 2D icons (not image sprites — procedural drawing for crisp scaling).

When the operator wakes up and runs `./test.sh fast`, all tiers pass. When they open `http://localhost:8000` and press B:

1. Units patrol along real streets on satellite imagery
2. Hostiles approach via roads, then cut through yards
3. Turrets engage with visible projectile trails and explosions
4. Kill feed, wave banners, and score all work
5. Synthetic camera PIP shows a convincing CCTV feed
6. Amy announces battle start, wave clears, and victory/defeat
7. The test report at `tests/.test-results/reports/` has timestamped screenshots proving every stage
