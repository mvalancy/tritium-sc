"""BLE device threat classification — known vs unknown, alerting on new MACs.

Maintains a set of known BLE device MACs and classifies incoming sightings
as known, unknown, new, or suspicious.  Publishes alerts to EventBus when
new or suspicious devices appear.

Classification levels:
    - known:      MAC exists in the known_devices set
    - unknown:    MAC is not known but has been seen before
    - new:        MAC has never been seen before (first sighting)
    - suspicious: unknown device with strong signal (RSSI > threshold)
