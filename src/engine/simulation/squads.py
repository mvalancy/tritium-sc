"""SquadManager — coordinated hostile unit formations with leader-follower dynamics.

Architecture
------------
SquadManager auto-detects clusters of hostile units and organizes them
into squads with formation-keeping behavior.  Each squad has a leader
(highest health), a formation type, and a shared target for focus fire.

Leader-follower hierarchy:
  - Each squad has an optional officer_rank (0=none, 1=sergeant, 2=lieutenant).
  - Cohesion (0.0-1.0) measures squad discipline; drops on leader elimination.
  - Leaders issue tactical orders: advance, hold, flank_left, flank_right, retreat.
  - Followers respond to orders by adjusting movement (hold=stop, flank=lateral
    offset, retreat=flee toward spawn edge).
  - When a leader is eliminated: cohesion drops to 0.3, retreat order issued for
    all members, morale penalty applied.
  - New leader is promoted by proximity to the old leader's position.
  - Cohesion slowly recovers (+0.01/s) when a new leader is active.
  - Orders expire after ORDER_TIMEOUT_S seconds (10s default).

Squad lifecycle:
  1. Auto-formation: When 2+ active hostiles are within SQUAD_RADIUS (15m)
     of each other, they are grouped into a squad.
  2. Tick: Each tick, the manager re-evaluates squads — updates leader
     (highest health), computes formation offsets, selects shared target,
     and nudges members toward their formation positions.
  3. Dissolution: Squads dissolve when <2 active members remain (eliminated
     or scattered beyond SQUAD_RADIUS).

Formation types:
  - ``wedge``: Leader at front, followers at 45 degrees behind, 4m spacing.
    Good for advancing on a position.
  - ``line``: Members side by side, 4m spacing, no depth offset.
    Good for wide-approach sweeps.
  - ``column``: Members in single file behind leader, 4m spacing.
  - ``circle``: Followers distributed evenly around leader at 4m radius.
    Good for defensive perimeters.

Integration:
  SquadManager.tick() is called from SimulationEngine._tick_loop during
  active game mode, after behaviors.tick() so that squad formation offsets
  layer on top of individual behavior decisions.
