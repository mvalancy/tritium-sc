"""DifficultyScaler — adaptive difficulty for wave-based combat.

Architecture
------------
DifficultyScaler tracks player performance across waves and computes a
``threat_multiplier`` that adjusts the next wave's hostiles.  The goal
is to keep the game in "the zone" — challenging enough for skilled players,
forgiving enough for newcomers.

Performance signals (per wave):
  - elimination_rate:  hostiles eliminated / hostiles spawned
  - wave_time:         seconds to clear the wave
  - friendly_damage_ratio:  total friendly damage / total friendly max health
  - escapes:           hostiles that escaped the map

The multiplier starts at 1.0 and adjusts +/-0.1 per wave based on a
composite performance score.  It is clamped to [0.5, 2.0].

Wave adjustments:
  - hostile_count = round(base_count * multiplier), minimum 1
  - hostile_health_bonus = max(0, (multiplier - 1.0) * 0.3)
  - hostile_speed_bonus  = max(0, (multiplier - 1.0) * 0.15)

Hardened variant (multiplier > 1.5):
  - Increased flank_chance
  - Cover-seeking enabled
  - 1 elite hostile with 2x health

Easy variant (multiplier < 0.7):
  - Flanking disabled
  - Slower hostile speed
  - Fewer hostiles (already via count formula)
