"""UnitMissionSystem — assigns backstories, goals, and active missions to all units.

Every unit gets:
1. A backstory/personality (LLM-generated async via Ollama, scripted fallback)
2. Starter mission assigned immediately at spawn (patrol, scout, hold, etc.)
3. Active mission loop — when a unit finishes its mission, it gets a new one

Friendly units NEVER sit idle. They are always patrolling, scouting, or
pursuing goals. The system also generates scenario context ("why is this
battle happening?") via LLM for loading screens and narrative.

Integration:
    engine._do_tick() calls unit_missions.tick(dt, targets_dict)
    engine.add_target() calls unit_missions.on_unit_added(target)
