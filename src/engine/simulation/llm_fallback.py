"""LLM fallback thought generator.

When Ollama is unavailable, produces context-aware scripted thoughts
so Amy always has an inner monologue. Thoughts are valid Lua function
calls parseable by parse_motor_output().

The system prefers gemma3:4b on localhost Ollama when available, and
falls back to this generator when the LLM is unreachable.
