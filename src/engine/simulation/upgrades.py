"""UpgradeSystem -- passive upgrades and active abilities for simulation units.

Architecture
------------
The UpgradeSystem manages two categories of enhancements:

  1. Upgrades (passive, permanent): stat modifiers applied to a unit.
     Multiple upgrades stack multiplicatively (e.g., two 1.2x speed
     upgrades = 1.44x speed).  Each upgrade has a max_stacks limit
     and optional type eligibility restriction.

  2. Abilities (active, cooldown-gated): temporary effects activated by
     the player.  Each ability has a cooldown, duration, and effect type.
     Instant abilities (duration=0) execute immediately (e.g., repair).
     Duration abilities create an ActiveEffect that modifies stats for
     the duration then expires.

Stat modifier pipeline:
  - Upgrades contribute multiplicative modifiers (stat * 1.2 * 1.15 = 1.38)
  - Active effects contribute additional modifiers (speed_boost, overclock)
  - damage_reduction is additive (0.15 from chassis + 0.5 from shield = 0.65)
  - The engine/combat system queries get_stat_modifier(target_id, stat) to
    get the combined modifier for use in damage/movement calculations.

Thread safety:
  The UpgradeSystem is designed to be called from the engine tick loop
  (single-threaded).  No internal locking is needed since the engine
  holds its lock during the tick and exposes UpgradeSystem through
  API endpoints that serialize access.

Backward compatibility:
  The engine works without the UpgradeSystem.  All stat modifiers
  default to 1.0 (no change) or 0.0 (no reduction), so existing
  code that doesn't query the system behaves identically.
